# Expense Tracker

An expense tracker in which you can allocate your budget for each category every month and you can spend money for each category

## How I made it?
- Programmed in Java using files as the storage choice.
- GUI is made using SceneBuilder and FXML.
- Users can choose to allocate money into pre-made catergories such as Rent, Savings, Fees, etc.
- Users have the option to add their own categories such as Computer, Car Repair, Anniversary, etc.
- The users can then choose to spend money from any of the categories chosen.
- There is an Analytics section where it shows all the money remaining in each category.
